# Comparison-and-Implementation-of-Centroid-based-clustering-algorithms

Comparison and Implementation of Centroid based clustering algorithms, kmeans and kmeans++ based on three data sets.

Developed and implemented clustering algorithms of k-means, k-means++ and PAM (Partition Around Medoids) on IRIS dataset, Electricity Board dataset and Two Dimensional datasets of REAL points. Verified the accuracy of the algorithms using Hamming distance validation technique. Also calculated the optimum number of clusters for given datasets using Elbow Method (WCSS-Within Cluster Sums of Squares).

Result observed: PAM showed better results using hamming distance validation technique as compared to k-means. But k-means++ showed the best results in most datasets.
